# dotfiles

My personal setup for some dotfiles

Clone the repository to the home directory

Run the script with ./symlink_script.sh

The script will create symlinks from the dotfiles in the home directory to the repository. (Open the script and make a small change according to the comments if the dotfiles exists in the home directory)
It will also download oh-my-zsh and make zsh as defualt shell
